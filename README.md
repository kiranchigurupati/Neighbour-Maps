# NeighborhoodMap
Part of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Program.

A single page application featuring a map of Manhattan neighborhood was developed. 
additional functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content was also added.

The neighborhood tour application is complex enough and incorporates a variety of data points that it can easily become unwieldy to manage.
There are a number of frameworks, libraries and APIs available to make this process more manageable and many employers are looking for specific skills in using these packages.

Features:
- Clicking on the markers on the map, will show the name of the location while the icon is bouncing.
- Clicking the name of the place in the SlideBar, will open Google Street View of that place, below the map.
- List items can be searched in the search bar.
- Page is fully Responsive and for CSS styling, Bootstrap library was used.
- for data binding between View and Model, KnockoutJS library was used.
- For other interaction, Vanilla JS and mostly JQuery were used.
